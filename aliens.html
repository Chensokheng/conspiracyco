                    <p id="conspiracy_para">A belief in extraterrestrial life is wide spread. Alien conspiracy theories range from Government cover-ups of the supposed Roswell UFO incident or activity at Area 51 to crop circles to the Egyptian Pyramids. </p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Aliens have some big believers. Winston Churchill, Edgar Mitchell (the sixth astronaut to "walk on the moon") and Ariana Grande are just a few.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Abductions: A well-known phenomena. Abductee victims typically claim to have been subjected to forced medical examinations. Abductees sometimes claim to have been warned against environmental abuse and the dangers of nuclear weapons. The first widely publicised abduction was that of Betty and Barney Hill in 1961.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">The Saints: This theory has gained traction as a result of the TV Show 'Ancient Aliens.' Theorists on the show have provided evidence to back their claims that Jesus, the Saints and Noah with his Ark weren't bestowed powers from God, they were actually just aliens. </p>
