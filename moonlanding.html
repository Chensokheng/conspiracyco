                <h1 id="conspiracy_title">The Moon Landing</h1>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">A conspiracy classic. This theory claims that NASA faked the landings. It is
                    believed that the landing was faked in order to win the Space Race. Some have claimed that as many
                    as 10 people involved in the Moon Landing program were killed by NASA as part of the cover-up.</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">The fact that we have never landed on the moon since then is proof to many that
                    we still do not know how to. In 1969 the technology for the internet, mobile phones and AI didn't
                    exist, yet we were advanced enough to land on the moon? Images are the greatest pieces of evidence
                    the moon landing was faked. The flag waves in the wind, yet there is no wind on the moon. There is
                    no blast crater created by the Lunar Module yet the astronauts supposedly left footprints? The angle
                    and colour of shadows are inconsistent. This suggests that artificial lights were used. Blueprints
                    and design and development drawings of the machines involved are missing. Apollo 11 data tapes of
                    the first moonwalk are also missing. Why would NASA allow such valuable items to disappear?</p>
