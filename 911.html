                    <h1 id="conspiracy_title">Bush did 9/11</h1>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Bush did 9/11. It's a widely held belief, and also a meme. But why? Without 9/11 the US had no reason for going to war in the Middle East and no way to the vast oil reserves. There are 3 main parts of 9/11: the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and Tower Seven.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Truthers point to how the Twin Towers fell like a controlled demolition. The fires in the towers were not strong enough to cause their collapse but nano-thermite could, traces of which were found in the wreck. Building work had taken place leading up to 9/11 - the perfect time to plant explosives. Melted steel beams were also found at Ground Zero however jet fuel fires are not strong enough to melt steal beams.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Most people don't know about Tower Seven at all or that it fell on 9/11. No plane crashed into it however. It is apparently the first and only steel skyscraper in the world to collapse because of fire. Truthers believe it was another controlled demolition.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">The Pentagon site is also under suspicion. Images of The Pentagon following 9/11 show little plane wreckage. No tail end, no engines, no wings, no damage to the lawn where the wings supposedly dragged. The structural damage was just too minimal. People also question why a plane was allowed to hit the Pentagon and not taken down, as protocol dictates? Many believe a bomb actually did the damage within the Pentagon, to further cause public panic.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Do you believe?</p>
