                <h1 id="conspiracy_title">MKUltra</h1>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">A theory that has been confirmed by the declassification of CIA documents.
                    People long believed that the American government were using, or at least testing, mind control.
                    MKUltra was the code name given to the program by the CIA. MKUltra aimed to perform experiments on
                    humans with the intent to identify and develop drugs that could be used in interrogations and force
                    confessions through mind control. They focused on LSD, heroin, weed, temazepam and hypnosis.</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">MKUltra saw illegal experiments being carried out by universities, hospitals,
                    prisons, and pharmaceutical companies on US and Canadian citizens. There have been many legal issues
                    with MKUltra as many of the participants were not informed that they were part of the program.
                    Several known deaths are attributed to MKUltra. One example is that of Dr Olson, a US Army
                    biochemist and researcher, who was given LSD without his knowledge or consent and committed suicide
                    by jumping out of a window a week later.</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">The program ceased in 1973, 20 years after it first began. However many believe
                    it simply went underground. The CIA director in 1973 had ordered the destruction of all MKUltra
                    making understanding the exact impact of the program difficult.</p>
