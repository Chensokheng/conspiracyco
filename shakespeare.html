                <p id="conspiracy_para">Who we know as Shakespeare and what we know as his works may not be true. We
                    truly know little about Shakespeare and his life, and what we do know can be somewhat confusing. His
                    whole family was illiterate and poor. There is no evidence he was educated. On every historical
                    document pertaining to him he signs and spells his name differently. Mentions of Shakespeare by
                    other historical figures mostly refer to him as an actor, not a writer. In his will he never
                    mentioned his large volume of works, nor was his will written in the same style as his supposed
                    works.</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">These facts have lead to the idea that Shakespeare is not who we think he is. It
                    is believed that his works were possibly written by Francis Bacon or Edward De Vere or Christopher
                    Marlowe. All of their lives and other known works match that of Shakespeare's. Others suggest that
                    Shakespeare's works are the work of a collective.</p>
