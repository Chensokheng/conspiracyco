                <h1 id="conspiracy_title">Malala</h1>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">Conspiracy Theories about Malala, the young Nobel Peace Prize winner who was
                    shot in the head by the Taliban are widespread, especially in Pakistan. It is alleged that she is a
                    spy, or her attempted murder was a secret operation designed to discredit the Taliban. It is claimed
                    that her father came up with the operational plan in collaboration with the CIA.</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">People in Pakistan find it hard to believe someone could survive being shot in
                    the head, and that the Taliban would bother to target one singular everyday girl. Some refer to her
                    as "Malala Dramazai," alleging that she staged her shooting to get a visa to a Western country.</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">This theory gained traction due to Dawn Newspaper, a Pakistan-based English
                    language newspaper, publishing a satirical piece in 2013. In the piece, a reporter supposedly
                    travels to Swat, the area Malala grew up in. There they find a doctor who claims to have a sample of
                    her DNA (earwax), which shows that she's of Hungarian descent. The reporter also finds that the
                    Taliban operative who tried to kill her was actually an Italian who looks a lot like Robert de Niro
                    in Taxi Driver. Despite this clearly being satire - it fed the flames.</p>
