                    <h1 id="conspiracy_title">Malala</h1>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Conspiracy Theories about Malala, the young Nobel Peace Prize winner who was shot in the head by the Taliban are widespread, especially in Pakistan. It is alleged that she is a spy, or her attempted murder was a secret operation designed to discredit the Taliban. It is claimed that her father came up with the operational plan in collaboration with the CIA.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">People in Pakistan find it hard to believe someone could survive being shot in the head, and that the Taliban would bother to target one singular everyday girl. Some refer to her as "Malala Dramazai," alleging that she staged her shooting to get a visa to a Western country.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">This theory gained traction due to Dawn Newspaper, a Pakistan-based English language newspaper, publishing a satirical piece in 2013. In the piece, a reporter supposedly travels to Swat, the area Malala grew up in. There they find a doctor who claims to have a sample of her DNA (earwax), which shows that she's of Hungarian descent. The reporter also finds that the Taliban operative who tried to kill her was actually an Italian who looks a lot like Robert de Niro in Taxi Driver. Despite this clearly being satire - it fed the flames.</p>
