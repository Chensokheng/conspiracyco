                    <h1 id="conspiracy_title">Chemtrails</h1>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">The chemtrail theory is based on the belief that long-lasting condensation trails left by airplanes are  actually filled with chemicals or biological agents hence are chemtrails. These trails are supposedly caused by the warm exhaust fumes reacting with the cold upper atmosphere. According to Ct'ers there are a variety of reasons why these chemtrails are left in the sky by high-flying aircraft and why they are spraying chemicals onto the general public. Theorists point to the fact that planes do not constantly leave chemtrails, that they appear to come from the plane at any time with no pattern. If the condensation trails were caused by exhaust fumes would they not be constant?</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Some Ct'ers believe these chemicals are used to control the weather. Others believe there are biological or chemical agents in the trails used to control population. Whether that be population levels or the behaviour of the general public. Some claim the increase in chemtrails correlates to the increase of violence in society. Overall truthers do not agree why this is happening, but simply that it is. Prince famously spoke about this theory, and his support in an interview in 2009.</p>
