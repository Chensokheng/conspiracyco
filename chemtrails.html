                <h1 id="conspiracy_title">Chemtrails</h1>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">The chemtrail theory is based on the belief that long-lasting condensation
                    trails left by airplanes are actually filled with chemicals or biological agents hence are
                    chemtrails. These trails are supposedly caused by the warm exhaust fumes reacting with the cold
                    upper atmosphere. According to Ct'ers there are a variety of reasons why these chemtrails are left
                    in the sky by high-flying aircraft and why they are spraying chemicals onto the general public.
                    Theorists point to the fact that planes do not constantly leave chemtrails, that they appear to come
                    from the plane at any time with no pattern. If the condensation trails were caused by exhaust fumes
                    would they not be constant?</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">Some Ct'ers believe these chemicals are used to control the weather. Others
                    believe there are biological or chemical agents in the trails used to control population. Whether
                    that be population levels or the behaviour of the general public. Some claim the increase in
                    chemtrails correlates to the increase of violence in society. Overall truthers do not agree why this
                    is happening, but simply that it is. Prince famously spoke about this theory, and his support in an
                    interview in 2009.</p>
