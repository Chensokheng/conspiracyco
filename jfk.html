                    <h1 id="conspiracy_title">JFK</h1>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Truthers believe that the CIA assassinated JFK. The CIA had many reasons to dislike JFK. He was cutting their budget, did not support their attempts at war in Cuba, he was asking a lot of questions about their findings on aliens and UFOs and he was "too weak" on Communism. Others believe it may have been the Mafia or the KGB. Theories have deepened as Trump held back classified documents about the JFK assassination from being de-classified. The official story is that JFK was assassinated by a lone shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald but he was murdered by Jack Ruby before he could be tried in a court of law. For many this is a great coincidence.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Ct'ers believe that possible Lee Harvey Oswald worked for the CIA and they set him up to take the blame. They then murdered him before he could talk. Others believe he was just a scapegoat, an entirely innocent man. The trajectory of the supposed shooting was not right and would have needed multiple shooters to cause the damage. The path the CIA chose for Kennedy offered more possible shooting angles than other possibilities.</p>
