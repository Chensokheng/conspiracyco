                <p id="conspiracy_para">The Egyptian Pyramids are an Ancient Wonder of the World. Supposedly built over
                    hundreds of years by thousands and slaves using logs and water to transport some of the most
                    precisely cut stone the world has ever seen. Many engineers today will tell you that modern
                    technology would struggle to build the Pyramids of Giza. </p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">So how did they do it? They didn't. Aliens did. A fascinating fact about the
                    Pyramids is that they line up exactly with the stars in Orionâ€™s belt, they were built facing
                    magnetic north and also have striking similarities to the Mayan Pyramids, which were built nearly
                    3000 years apart and over 7000 miles apart. There is no evidence that the two cultures ever
                    collided. </p>
