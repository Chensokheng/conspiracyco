                    <h1 id="conspiracy_title">Donald Trump</h1>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">A believer himself, Trump has showed his support and also created some ?questionable? theories himself - here's a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/13/politics/donald-trump-conspiracy-theories/index.html">list.</a> He is also subject to several conspiracy theories himself. Is he a Putin puppet? Did he even want to become president? Is he part of a Deep State conspiracy? Here's some of our favourites:</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Theory: He is a puppet and just an actor. David Icke, the famed British CT'er is at the forefront of this theory. He believes that Trump is just an actor, as are his opposers and that the political turmoil created by Trump is designed to distract us from bigger issues such as AI, our freedoms being diminished etc. This is not a theory unique to Trump and is believed about many Heads of State.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Theory: He is a Reptilian. Like many leading public figures, Trump is believed by some to be a Reptilian. Reptilians are just one type of alien species. The Reptilians are committed to meddling with society and are in every level of authority worldwide. Others include the Queen of England, Henry Kissinger and Bob Hope. Reptilians are thought to be the driving force behind many human tragedies.</p>
