                <h1 id="conspiracy_title">UFOs</h1>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">UFO sightings have been recorded all through history. From Ancient Egypt to 16th
                    Century Switzerland to 19th Century Japan until the phenomena exploded in the 20th Century, with
                    most sightings being reported in the US.</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">The American government has been at the forefront of this theory. They have
                    spent millions researching UFOs themselves. The late 20th Century saw the American public fascinated
                    with UFOs, leading to many saying that the reported UFO sightings were the result of creative
                    imaginations. Reports exploded after a key event - Roswell.</p>
                <p id="conspiracy_para">Roswell: In the summer of 1947, a rancher discovered unidentifiable debris in
                    his sheep pasture outside Roswell, New Mexico. Many believed it was the remains of an
                    extraterrestrial flying saucer as there were "unearthly" objects within the wreckage. The debris was
                    gathered by the American military. Later they issued a press release saying they had a UFO in their
                    possession. The next day another press release was issued stating it was a weather balloon -
                    something the wreckage certainly didn't resemble. Suspicious?</p>
