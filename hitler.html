                    <h1 id="conspiracy_title">Hitler escaped</h1>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Could a man with so much power find a way to escape to South America and never face justice for his crimes? That is the belief here. People across the world have claimed to have seen Hitler, or to even have photographs of him post 1945. They remember him as a family friend or an uncle.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">It is claimed he planned to start a 'Fourth Reich.' Investigators of the History Channel series Hunting Hitler found previously classified documents and interviewed witnesses indicating that Hitler escaped from Germany and traveled to South America by U-boat or plane. In Argentina they found German style barracks possibly used by Nazis who escaped alongside Hitler. Several high profile Nazis were later found in South America including Adolph Eichmann (the architect of the 'Final Solution') and Josef Mengele. The CIA were also skeptical, a declassified memo found they had searched for Hitler in Argentina.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">The Russians were suspicious too and in 2009 tested two pieces of skull they found in the Fuherbunker that was supposedly Hitler's. It was found to belong to a female under 40.</p>
                    <p id="conspiracy_para">Do you believe?</p>
